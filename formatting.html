    <p> <strong>Dear mom,</strong> <br> I am glad that I was raised by a strong woman like you. Seeing you, I have learned to get up each time I hit the rock bottom in life. You have been my <q>strength</q>  and <q>inspiration</q> . You have taught me to believe in myself and help others. Such valuable lessons helped me in life.

        <strike>I am sorry for making you worry at times </strike> <u> but thank you for all those moments when you were there for me even when the whole world was against me </u>. It gave me the courage to go in my chosen path. Never stop guiding and supporting me, as I do not know what I would do without you. <br> <hr> <mark> i love you mom </mark></p>
